# screen
The goal of this project are to create a LLVM pass which runs over the S2N codebase on each commit and performs compiler assisted invariant detection.

This lets us find every control-flow and variable range deviation automatically, on every checkin.


Current S2N defenses:
- constant time routines to maintain speed
- if any errors in client<->server connection: randomization [10,30]
- human review for memory, want: taint analysis to verify code paths are constant, memory access patterns side channels

Purpose of this tool, using annotations:

1. A-B no branches
2. A-C no branches that depend on secret memory
3. A-D branch that depend on secret memory: print upper bound of set (e.g., proof that no new memory access patterns)

Targeting: arm, x86

## Running the pass
Include the screen.h header file in all builds of LLVM bitcode.

Annotations are as follows:
For full function anaylsis use:

SCREEN(screen_function_paths) 

For analysis in between two instructions use:
SCREEN_START(screen_paths_start) char a = 'a';
SCREEN_END(screen_paths_end) char b = 'b';

## Opt Command Line Flags (Manditory)
```
-screen
	Runs main pass

-screen-output=<string>                                        
	Provide an output file for screen output

-screen-start-symbol=<string>                                  
	Provide a symbol in the program to treat as the _start, , usually main for most cases
```
